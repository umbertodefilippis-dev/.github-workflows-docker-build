Implementation Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use
   of this frame kernel must "load" the kernel normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates the data items with
   their names in a data structure called the "kernel pool".  The SPICELIB
   routine FURNSH loads a kernel into the pool as shown below:

     FORTRAN: (SPICELIB)

       CALL FURNSH ( frame_kernel_name )

     C: (CSPICE)

       furnsh_c ( frame_kernel_name );

     IDL: (ICY)

       cspice_furnsh, frame_kernel_name

     MATLAB: (MICE)

          cspice_furnsh ( 'frame_kernel_name' )

     PYTHON: (SPICEYPY)*

          furnsh( frame_kernel_name )

   In order for a program or routine to extract data from the pool, the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL, GIPOOL, and GCPOOL are used.  See [2] for
   more details.

   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.

   * SPICEYPY is a non-official, community developed Python wrapper for the
     NAIF SPICE toolkit. Its development is managed on Github.
     It is available at: https://github.com/AndrewAnnex/SpiceyPy

JUICE Spacecraft Bus Frame
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The spacecraft frame is defined by the s/c design as follows [4]:

      -  +Z is perpendicular to the launch vehicle interface plane
         and points toward the payload side, through the spacecraft
         in the launch direction;

      -  -X axis is perpendicular to the HGA mounting plane and points
         in the direction of the nominal HGA boresight;

      -  +Y axis completes the right-handed frame.

      -  the origin of this frame is the launch vehicle interface point,
         located at the separation plane between the spacecraft and the
         launch adapter, in the centre of the launch adapter.


   These diagrams illustrate the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame:

   by a Switch Frame (see [1] for more information) aligned with one of
   the different CK-based base frames (JUICE_SPACECRAFT_MEAS or

   The JUICE spacecraft planning reference frame -- JUICE_SPACECRAFT_PLAN --
   is defined in order to accommodate the C-kernels that have been generated
   with a fictional SCLK kernel. These CK kernels contain predicted and test
   data and are used for planning purposes.

   The before-mentioned CKs are generated with a fictional SCLK kernel due to
   the fact that successive updates of the real SCLK kernel would lead to
   erroneous results for the predicted data provided by those kernels after
   the last Time Correlation Packet offered by the real SCLK.

   Since the s/c bus predicted attitude is defined with respect to an inertial
   frame and provided by a C-kernel (see [3] for more information), this frame
   is defined as a CK-based frame. These sets of keywords define the
   JUICE_SPACECRAFT_PLAN frame.

JUICE Spacecraft Nadir Frame
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The spacecraft nadir frame is defined by the ``Nadir'' direction.
   The Nadir direction has been tuned to provide the best pointing budgets.
   It has been calculated using the barycenter of the boresight of the
   relevant instruments -- JANUS, UVS, SWI, GALA -- except for MAJIS due
   to its large internal alignment error (from [25]).

      -  +Z is the barycenter of the boresight of JANUS, UVS, SWI, and GALA;

      -  -X axis is in the perpendicular plane to the HGA mounting plane and
         points in the direction of the nominal HGA boresight;

      -  +Y axis completes the right-handed frame.

      -  the origin of this frame is the launch vehicle interface point,
         located at the separation plane between the spacecraft and the
         launch adapter, in the centre of the launch adapter.

   The diagrams above illustrate the JUICE_SPACECRAFT_NADIR frame with the
   Nadir direction.

   The alignment is introduced as three rotations expressed in arcseconds
   from spacecraft to nadir reference frames from [26]:

     Rotation = (     0.0,    -121.0,     -119.0  )
       SC -> NADIR       Rz        Ry         Rx

   These values were updated in the last alignment campaign before launch
   in Kourou [27]:

     Rotation = (     0.0,    -160.0,      -67.0  )
       SC -> NADIR       Rz        Ry         Rx

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the
   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the
   opposite from what is written in the above text.

JUICE Spacecraft Charging Frame
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The spacecraft charging frame is nominally aligned with the``Nadir'' frame
   -- JUICE_SPACECRAFT_NADIR -- and is used for the charging model of the
   spacecraft.

      -  +Z is the barycenter of the boresight of JANUS, UVS, SWI, and GALA;

      -  -X axis is in the perpendicular plane to the HGA mounting plane and
         points in the direction of the nominal HGA boresight;

      -  +Y axis completes the right-handed frame.

      -  the origin of this frame is the intersection between the line aligned
         with the boresight of the HGA and the line going through the center
         of the +Z panel (parallel to the spacecraft Z axis).

   defined with respect to JUICE_SPACECRAFT, as follows:

      -  +Y is parallel to the longest side of the array, positively
         oriented from the yoke to the end of the wing;

      -  +Z is aligned to the spacecraft bus -X, pointing on the
         nominal direction of the HGA;

      -  +X completes the right-handed frame.

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the yoke geometric
         center.


   The rest of Solar Array frames -- JUICE_SA+Y, JUICE_SA+Y_PLAN,
   JUICE_SA+Y_MEAS, JUICE_SA-Y, JUICE_SA-Y_PLAN, JUICE_SA-Y_MEAS -- are
   defined as follows:

      -  +Y is parallel to the longest side of the array, positively oriented
         from the yoke to the end of the wing;

      -  +Z is normal to the solar array plane, the solar cells facing +Z;

      -  +X completes the right-handed frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the yoke geometric center.


   The axis of rotation is parallel to the Y axis of the spacecraft and the
   solar array frames. Please note that in all the diagrams of this file the
   Solar Arrays are rotated 90 degrees.

   The solar array frames JUICE_SA-Y and JUICE_SA+Y are implemented as
   Switch frame and their orientation is provided by either JUICE_SA+Y_MEAS
   and JUICE_SA-Y_MEAS when measured orientation is available or by
   JUICE_SA+Y_PLAN and JUICE_SA-Y_PLAN when predicted orientation is
   available (see Section ``JUICE Spacecraft Bus Frame'' and [1] for more
   information).

   This diagram illustrates the JUICE_SA+Y and JUICE_SA-Y frames:

JUICE High Gain Antenna Frames
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   JUICE spacecraft has a 2.4m diameter High Gain Antenna in X- and Ka-bands
   for nominal operations, Science data download and Radio Science
   Experiments. It is used as a sunshield during the cruise phase when close
   to the Sun.

   The JUICE High Gain Antenna, HGA, is rigidly attached to
   the -X side of the spacecraft bus. Therefore, the JUICE High Antenna
   frame, JUICE_HGA, is defined as a fixed offset frame with its orientation
   given relative to the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame.

   The JUICE_HGA frame is defined as follows:

      -  +Z axis is in the antenna boresight direction (nominally
         co-aligned to the spacecraft -X axis);

      -  +Y axis is in the direction of the spacecraft +Y axis;

      -  +X completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the geometric center of the
         HGA dish outer rim circle.

   X- and Ka-band antenna frames are defined such that their axes are
   nominally co-aligned with the axes of the JUICE_HGA frame and their
   origins are at the geometric centre of the HGA dish outer rim circle.
   These frames are introduced in order to include any possible misalignments
   between the X- and Ka-band pointing direction (maximum radiation power
   direction and gain).

   This diagram illustrates the JUICE High Gain Antenna frames:

   Nominally a single rotation of -90 degrees about the +Y axis is needed to
   co-align the spacecraft frame with the High Gain Antenna frame.

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the
   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the
   opposite from what is written in the above text.

JUICE Medium Gain Antenna Frames
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Medium Gain Antenna (MGA) provides communication during cruise when the
   HGA is used as sunshield. At Jupiter, the MGA support the Radio Science
   Experiment (RSE) in parallel to observation by other instruments
   (in nadir pointing). It also supports emergency up- and downlink in safe
   mode. To provide a maximum coverage, the MGA is mounted on a steerable
   boom with two pointing mechanisms.

   The MGA Main Assembly (MGAMA) is accommodated at the -X/-Y/+Z corner of the
   spacecraft. Its Antenna Pointing Mechanism (APM) with two degrees of
   freedom provides a full spherical articulation range.

   To incorporate rotations in the antenna pointing mechanisms gimbals with
   respect to the medium gain antenna the MGA frame chain includes the
   following frames: JUICE_MGA_APM, JUICE_MGA_AZ, JUICE_MGA_EL_ZERO,
   JUICE_MGA_EL and JUICE_MGA.

   The Medium Gain Antenna Pointing Mechanisms frame -- JUICE_MGA_APM -- is
   defined as a fixed-offset frame with respect to the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame
   as follows (from [18]):

      -  +Z is parallel to the JUICE s/c +Z axis;

      -  +X is anti-parallel to the JUICE s/c +X axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the APM yoke geometric
         center.


   The JUICE Medium Gain Antenna Azimuth frame -- JUICE_MGA_AZ -- is a
   Switch Frame (see Section ``JUICE Spacecraft Bus Frame'' and [1] for more
   information) aligned with one of the different CK-based base frames
   -- JUICE_MGA_AZ_MEAS or JUICE_MGA_AZ_PLAN -- depending on the available
   orientation data or coverage of these data. The orientation of these
   CK-based base frames are relative to the JUICE_MGA_APM frame and are
   rotated an Azimuth Angle about the JUICE_MGA_APM +Z axis. They are
   defined as follows:

      - +Y axis is rotated an Azimuth Angle from the JUICE_MGA_APM frame +Y
        axis around the JUICE_MGA_APM frame +Z axis;

      - +Z axis is parallel to the JUICE_MGA_APM frame +Z axis;

      - +X completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the APM yoke geometric
         center.


   The JUICE Medium Gain Antenna Elevation Zero frame -- JUICE_MGA_EL_ZERO --
   is defined as a fixed-offset frame with respect to the JUICE_MGA_AZ frame
   as follows:

      - +Z axis is anti-parallel to the JUICE_MGA_AZ frame +Z axis;

      - +X axis is anti-parallel to the JUICE_MGA_AZ frame +X axis;

      - +Y completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the APM yoke geometric
         center.

   The JUICE Medium Gain Antenna Elevation frame -- JUICE_MGA_EL -- is a
   Switch Frame (see Section ``JUICE Spacecraft Bus Frame'' and [1] for more
   information) aligned with one of the different CK-based base frames
   -- JUICE_MGA_EL_MEAS or JUICE_MGA_EL_PLAN -- depending on the available
   orientation data or coverage of these data. The orientation of these
   CK-based base frames are relative to the JUICE_MGA_EL_ZERO frame and is
   rotated an Elevation Angle about the JUICE_MGA_EL_ZERO +Y axis. They are
   defined as follows:

      - +X axis is rotated an Elevation Angle from the JUICE_MGA_EL_ZERO frame
        +X axis around the JUICE_MGA_EL_ZERO frame +Yaxis;

      - +Y axis is parallel to the JUICE_MGA_EL_ZERO frame +Y axis;

      - +Z completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the APM yoke geometric
         center.


   The JUICE Medium Gain Antenna -- JUICE_MGA -- frame is defined a fixed
   offset frame relative to the JUICE_MGA_EL as follows:

      -  +Y axis points from the gimbal toward the antenna dish
         symmetry axis;

      -  +Z axis is in the antenna boresight direction;

      -  +X axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the geometric center of
         the MGA dish outer rim circle.


   The MGA stowed position is at Azimuth = -180 deg and Elevation = 180 deg.
   After release, it is driven to a nominal position of Azimuth = 0 deg
   and Elevation = 0 deg. The rotations of the Azimuth and Elevation angles
   are stored in separated segments in CK files.

   In order to implement the misalignments from [21] the following calculations
   have been performed:

      -  JUICE_MGA_APM is defined by the rotation matrix 'AZRF > SCRF' from
         [22], in addition a rotation of 90 degrees is applied around Y axis
         in order to nominally align the azimuth axis from [22] with the
         spacecraft Z axis.

      -  JUICE_MGA_EL_ZERO is defined by the rotation matrix
         'SCRF > ELRF (for AZ rot 180 degrees EL 180 degrees)' from [22]
         introducing the misalignment in the elevation axis. In addition two
         rotations of -90 degrees around X axis and 90 degrees around Z axis
         are performed to nominally coaling the elevation axis and the Y-axis
         of the azimuth frame for elevation equal to 0 degrees. The resulting
         matrix is multiplied by the rotation matrix to transform from
         JUICE_SPACECRAFT to JUICE_MGA_APM so to obtain the rotation matrix
         to transform from JUICE_MGA_EL_ZERO to JUICE_MGA_AZ (equivalent to
         JUICE_MGA_APM for azimuth equal to 0 degrees).

      -  The correction of the positions of the APM Center and Phase Centers
         has been obtained by iterating the process of correcting first the
         APM Center applying the error calculated by comparing the average
         point of all the azimuth range with elevation equal to 0 for both
         SPICE data and [22] data. The position correction is then applied to
         the phase center by obtaining the average point for one elevation
         revolution for both SPICE data and [22] data.

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the
   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the
   opposite from what is written in the above text.

JUICE Low Gain Antenna Frames
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The low gain antenna is an essential component of the spacecraft in an
   emergency case. The three main phases from the communication perspective
   are the Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP), the commissioning and cruise
   phase, and the operational phase at Jupiter. During and after separation,
   full antenna coverage is necessary before a stable attitude is achieved,
   requiring two antennas with spherical coverage. In case of spacecraft
   survival mode, the LGAs provide the communication capability for recovery
   by ground operation.

   The optimum location of the LGAs providing maximum coverage is found on -X
   and +X side of the s/c, thus looking into HGA direction, respectively
   into the opposite direction of the HGA.

   The LGA installed in the +X panel of the JUICE Spacecraft frame
   -- JUICE_LGA+X -- is a  ``fixed-offset'', defined with respect to the
   JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame as follows (from [15]):

      -  +Z axis is in the antenna boresight direction (nominally
         co-aligned to the spacecraft +X axis);

      -  +Y axis is in the direction of the spacecraft +X axis;

      -  +X completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the geometric center of the
         LGA dish outer rim circle.


   The LGA installed in the -X panel of the JUICE Spacecraft frame

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the
   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the
   opposite from what is written in the above text.

JUICE Magnetometer Boom Frames
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section contains the definition of the Magnetometer Boom (MAG Boom)
   frames.

   The Magnetometer Boom (MAG Boom) is one of the Instrument Supporting
   structures of the JUICE spacecraft. The MAG Boom is attached to the
   -X/-Z corner of the spacecraft main body and supports toward its outer
   end the J-MAG Inboard, Outboard and Scalar magnetometer sensors, and
   the Radio Wave Instrument and the Search Coil Magnetometer of the
   Radio and Plasma Wave Instrument (RPWI) experiments.

   The MAG Boom is a deployable structure comprising that ranges from
   3.6m long in stowed configuration at launch (along +Zsc axis), up to
   10.6m long in deployed configuration (in the -Xc, -Zsc quadrant).

MAG Boom Hinge frame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Magnetometer's boom hinge  -- JUICE_MAG_BOOM-H -- which is at the
   interface of the boom to the s/c -- not to be confused with the two
   hinges in the boom -- is defined as follows (from [24]):

      -  +X axis is nominally co-aligned with the s/c +Z mechanical
         axis; and co-aligned with the boom's third segment where the
         sensors are mounted such this axis points from the inboard
         magnetometer sensor towards the scalar magnetometer.

      -  +Z axis is nominally co-aligned with the s/c +X mechanical
         axis, pointing opposite the HGA;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame; and its nominally co-aligned
         with the Magnetometer boom's hinge rotation axis;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the boom's hinge geometrical
         center.

MAG Boom frame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Since both, pre- and post- deployment orientation of the Magnetometer
   Boom could be required for J-MAG and RPWI data analysis, the boom's frame
   is defined as a CK-based frame with its orientation provided in CK files.
   This frame is describing the time dependent relationship between the
   Magnetometer Boom hinge and JUICE spacecraft fixed frames.

   Nominally the boom deploys from the boom hinge +X direction, making an angle
   of 141 deg from the spacecraft +Z axis after deployment.

   The Magnetometer Boom frame is defined as follows (from [24]):

      -  +X axis is parallel to the boom and points from the boom
         deployment hinge toward its tip; and in stowed configuration
         is nominally co-aligned with the s/c +Z axis;

      -  +Y axis is parallel to the Magnetometer boom's hinge rotation axis;

      -  +Z axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the boom's hinge geometrical
         center.


   The following diagram illustrates the JUICE MAG Boom frame:

JUICE Star Trackers Frames
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   There are three Star Trackers Optical Heads (STR-OHs) mounted in the
   +X s/c Panel (Opposite side of the HGA panel). The STRs are nominally
   oriented with their boresights with a given azimuth and elevation angles
   with respect to the s/c reference frame as follows from [14]:


                   | Azimuth (degrees) | Elevation (degrees)
         ----------+-------------------+--------------------
          STR-OH1  |      -51.1        |      -40.2
          STR-OH2  |      -15.0        |        5.0
          STR-OH3  |       58.2        |      -44.8


   The X and Y axis of the STR frames are aligned with the sensors
   Active Pixel Sensor (APS) rows and columns respectively.

   The Star Tracker STR-OH1, STR-OH2 and STR-OH3 frames -- JUICE_STR-OH1,
   JUICE_STR-OH2 and JUICE_STR-OH3 -- are defined as follows:

      -  +Z axis points along the Star Tracker boresight;

      -  +X axis is nominally parallel to the APS sensor rows;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the Star Tracker focal
         point.

   Nominally, the following rotations, first about +Y, then about +Z
   and then about +Y, are required in order to align each of the
   JUICE_STR-OHx frames to the s/c frame.


                             Rotation     Rotation      Rotation

           JUICE_STR-OH3     90.0 deg      58.2 deg      44.8 deg

JUICE Navigation Cameras Frames
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The two JUICE Navigation Cameras (NavCam) are accommodated on the optical
   bench close to the STR-OH providing high pointing accuracy and stability
   to all the units.

   The Jupiter NavCam frames -- JUICE_NAVCAM-1 and JUICE_NAVCAM-2 --
   are defined as follows:

      -  +Z axis points along the Camera boresight;

      -  +X axis is nominally parallel to the CCD sensor lines;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the Camera focal
         point.

   The JUICE_NAVCAM-* are nominally co-aligned with the JUICE s/c frame.

   The instrument alignment has been measured after mechanical tests
   during the fourth alignment campaign as reported in [26]. The following
   misalignment is introduced as three rotations expressed in arcseconds from
   spacecraft to NAVCAM-* instrument reference frames:

     Rotation = (     0.0,    757.0,      23.0  )
       SC -> NAVCAM-1    Rz        Ry         Rx

     Rotation = (     0.0,   -605.0,    1691.0  )
       SC -> NAVCAM-2    Rz        Ry         Rx


   Using in-flight images from 28th June 2023 of background stars and Neptune,
   and images of the Moon and Earth from the Lunar-Earth fly-by, the following
   misalignment has been computed in arcseconds from spacecraft to NAVCAM-1
   instrument reference frame:

     Rotation = (   518.6,    643.2,     -27.2  )
       SC -> NAVCAM-1    Rz        Ry         Rx


   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the

   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed

JUICE Monitoring Cameras Frames
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Two JUICE Monitoring Units (JMU) and two JUICE Monitoring Cameras (JMC) are
   accommodated to enhance the observability of the spacecraft and its
   instruments, at marginal impact on spacecraft design and its budgets
   (power, mass).

   The small size of the camera (100 x 100 x 100 mm) helps to accommodate it
   on the optimum position, here also without impact on spacecraft design. The
   first camera is accommodated on the bottom of the +X wall, looking in +Z/+Y
   direction toward RIME +X antenna and +Y solar wing. The second camera is
   accommodated on the top of the +Z/+Y edge, looking towards -X/-Y allowing to
   monitor the first hinges of RIME -X antenna. Both cameras thus benefit from
   the +X spacecraft face favourable environment (no direct Sun illumination).

   The JUICE Monitoring Cameras frames -- JUICE_JMC-1 and JUICE_JMC-2 --
   are defined as follows:

      -  +Z axis points along the Camera boresight;

      -  +X axis is nominally parallel to the CMOS sensor lines;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the Camera focal
         point.

GALA instrument Base frame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The GALA main unit is rigidly mounted on the spacecraft science deck.
   Therefore, the frame associated with it -- the GALA main unit base
   frame, JUICE_GALA_BASE --  is specified as a fixed offset frame relative
   with its orientation given relative to the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame.

   The GALA main unit base frame is defined by the laser altimeter design
   and its mounting on the spacecraft as follows:

      -  +Z axis is along the nominal GALA laser head transmitter and
         receiver telescope boresights; it is nominally co-aligned with the
         spacecraft +Z axis;

      -  +Y axis is co-aligned with the +Y spacecraft axis;

      -  +X axis completes the right-handed frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the center of the GALA
         reference hole (RH) at the instrument's interface plane, i.e. the
         unit mounting plane to the spacecraft.

   Any misalignment between the nominal and actual GALA mounting alignment
   measured pre-launch should be incorporated into the definition of this
   frame.


   This diagram illustrates nominal JUICE_GALA_BASE frame with respect to
   the spacecraft frame.

   Nominally, the GALA base frame is co-aligned with the s/c frame.

   The instrument alignment has been measured after mechanical tests
   during the fourth alignment campaign as reported in [26]. The following
   misalignment is introduced as three rotations expressed in arcseconds from
   spacecraft to GALA instrument reference frames:

     Rotation = (     0.0,    -30.0,    -175.0  )
         SC -> GALA     Rz        Ry         Rx

   These values were updated in the last alignment campaign before launch
   in Kourou [27]:

     Rotation = (     0.0,   -183.0,      33.0  )
         SC -> GALA     Rz        Ry         Rx

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the

J-MAG frames definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The J-MAG experiment comprises three sensors mounted in the JUICE
   Magnetometer Boom at different distances from the boom's hinge. The
   innermost is called the in-board sensor (MAGIBS) and it is a fluxgate
   magnetometer. A second fluxgate magnetometer, called  the out-board
   sensor (MAGOBS), is located approximately 3 meters away toward the end
   of the boom. A scalar magnetometer (MAGSCA) is located at the tip.

   The MAGIBS sensor frame -- JUICE_JMAG_MAGIBS -- is defined as follows
   (from [24]):

      -  +X axis is parallel to the boom and points from the boom
         deployment hinge toward the sensor;

      -  +Y axis is rotated 150 degrees around the +X axis from the
         boom +Y axis;

      -  +Z axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the URF reference point
         hole -- located on one of the holes of the sensor baseplate.


   The MAGIBS sensor magnetic system science frame -- JUICE_JMAG_MAGIBS_SCI --
   is defined as follows (from [28]):

      -  +X axis is parallel to the boom and points from the boom deployment
         hinge toward the sensor (parallel to JUICE_JMAG_MAGIBS +X);

      -  +Y axis is rotated 150 degrees around the +X axis from the
         boom +Y axis (parallel to JUICE_JMAG_MAGIBS +Y);

      -  +Z axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the geometric center of
         the sensor.


   The MAGOBS sensor frame -- JUICE_JMAG_MAGOBS -- is defined as follows
   (from [24]):

      -  +X axis is parallel to the boom's +Z axis;

      -  +Y axis is parallel to the boom and points from the sensor
         toward the boom deployment hinge;

      -  +Z axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the geometric center of
         the sensor.


   The MAGOBS sensor magnetic system science frame -- JUICE_JMAG_MAGOBS_SCI --
   is defined as follows (from [28]):

      -  +Z axis is parallel to the boom and points from the sensor
         toward the boom deployment hinge (parallel to JUICE_JMAG_MAGOBS +Y);

      -  +X axis is perpendicular to the boom (parallel to
         JUICE_JMAG_MAGOBS +X);

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame (parallel to
         the spacecraft -Y axis);

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the geometric center of
         the sensor.


   The MAGSCA sensor frame -- JUICE_JMAG_MAGSCA -- is defined as follows
   (from [24]):

      -  +X axis is the optical axis and is co-aligned with the
         spacecraft +Z axis;

      -  +Y axis is co-aligned with the spacecraft +Y axis;

      -  +Z axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the geometric center of
         the sensor.


   The MAGSCA sensor magnetic system science frame -- JUICE_JMAG_MAGSCA_SCI --
   is defined as follows (from [28]):

      -  +X axis is the optical axis and is co-aligned with the
         spacecraft +Z axis (parallel to JUICE_JMAG_MAGSCA +Z);

      -  +Y axis is co-aligned with the spacecraft +Y axis
         (parallel to JUICE_JMAG_MAGSCA +Y);

      -  +Z axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the geometric center of
         the sensor.


   The JUICE_JMAG_MAGSCA and JUICE_JMAG_MAGSCA_SCI frame definitions assume
   that the spacecraft Magnetometer Boom is nominally deployed with an angle
   of 141 deg. In order to account for deviations, the frame is defined as a
   Switch Frame (see [1] for more information) aligned with one of the
   different CK-based base frames -- JUICE_JMAG_MAGSCA_PLAN or
   JUICE_JMAG_MAGSCA_MEAS -- depending on coverage and their orientation
   is given relative to JUICE_MAG_BOOM.


   This diagram illustrates the J-MAG sensors' frames:

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the
   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the
   opposite from what is written in the above text.

   The JACS is composed by two irregular octagon shaped coils, JACS-X
   contained in the -X s/c plane and JACS-Y contained in the -Y s/c plane.

   The JACS-X frame -- JUICE_JACS-X -- is defined as follows:

      -  +X axis is anti-parallel to s/c +Y axis;

      -  +Y axis is parallel to the s/c +Z axis;

      -  +Z axis completes the right hand frame and is anti-parallel to
         the s/c +X axis, normal to the octagon plane;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the geometric center
         of the octagon.


   The JACS-Y frame -- JUICE_JACS-Y -- is defined as follows:

      -  +X axis is parallel to s/c +X axis;

      -  +Y axis is parallel to the s/c +Z axis;

      -  +Z axis completes the right hand frame and is anti-parallel to
         the s/c +Y axis, normal to the octagon plane;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the geometric center
         of the octagon.


   For each segment of both JACS, the reference frame - JUICE_JACS-X_n and
   JUICE_JACS-Y_n - are defined as follows:

      -  +X axis is parallel to the segment, pointing from the corner n
         towards the next corner in a counter-clockwise direction;

      -  +Z axis is normal to the octagon plane;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the corner n of the octagon.


   The following diagrams show the location of each of the JACS-X and
   JACS-Y corners.

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the
   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the
   opposite from what is written in the above text.

MAJIS frames definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Currently, there are four different frames defined for the Moons and
   Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer (MAJIS), each aiming at incorporating
   different possible misalignments:

      -  JUICE_MAJIS_BASE is a fixed-offset frame aiming at introducing
         any possible misalignment between the the instrument mirror
         rotation axis and the spacecraft +X axis. This misalignment is
         constant therefore this frame is defined as a fixed offset
         frame relative to the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame.

      -  JUICE_MAJIS_SCAN is defined to capture orientation of the
         reflected instrument view direction due to the scan mirror
         motion. This frame is defined as a Switch Frame (see [1] for
         more information) aligned with one of the different CK-based
         base frames -- JUICE_MAJIS_SCAN_PLAN or JUICE_MAJIS_SCAN_MEAS
         -- depending on coverage.

      -  JUICE_MAJIS_VISNIR and JUICE_MAJIS_IR are defined to capture
         misalignments for each of the two instrument channels relative to
         the reflected view direction. These frames are defined as fixed
         offset frames relative to the JUICE_MAJIS_SCAN frame.


   Each of the MAJIS frames listed above is defined in the same way
   as follows (from [7]):

      -  +Z axis points along the boresight (for JUICE_MAJIS boresight
         is the nominal center pixel view direction for the scan mirror
         in "zero" position; for JUICE_MAJIS_SCAN boresight is the
         nominal center pixel view direction, "off-pointed" due to the
         scan mirror; for JUICE_MAJIS_VISNIR and JUICE_MAJIS_IR
         boresight is the particular detector center pixel view
         direction, "off-pointed" due to the scan mirror; adjusted for
         all known misalignments with the scan mirror in "zero" position)

      -  +X axis is parallel to the apparent spatial resolution
         direction; it is nominally co-aligned with the s/c +X axis.
         The spatial pixels readout direction is opposite to +X axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the instrument focal
         point for JUICE_MAJIS_VISNIR and JUICE_MAJIS_IR frames and at
         the intersection of the nominal center pixel view direction
         and the scan mirror axis for JUICE_MAJIS and JUICE_MAJIS_SCAN
         frames.


   This diagram illustrates the MAJIS frames orientation (with MAJIS scan
   mirror in "zero" position) with respect to the spacecraft frame.

   Nominally, in "zero" scan mirror position all four MAJIS frames are
   co-aligned with each other and the s/c frame.

   The instrument alignment has been measured after mechanical tests
   during the fourth alignment campaign as reported in [26]. The following
   misalignment is introduced as three rotations expressed in arcseconds from
   spacecraft to MAJIS instrument reference frames:

     Rotation = (   2940.0,   -882.0,    1139.0  )
         SC -> MAJIS     Rz        Ry         Rx

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the
   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the
   opposite from what is written in the above text.

   The MAJIS cryogenic and standard radiators are accommodated above the
   optical head, towards s/c +X axis. The MAJIS radiator frame
   - JUICE_MAJIS_RAD - is defined as follows (from [15]):

      -  +Z axis is anti-parallel to the boresight of the scan mirror
         in "zero" position;

      -  +X axis is anti-parallel to the s/c +X axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the radiator mounting point
         above the optical head.

PEP Nadir Unit frames definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Currently, there are four different frames defined for the Particle
   Environment Package (PEP) Nadir Unit (NU) aiming at incorporating different
   possible misalignments between the spacecraft and the different sensors:

      -  JUICE_PEP_NU is a fixed-offset frame aiming at introducing
         any possible misalignment between the Nadir Unit base mounting
         plate and the spacecraft frame. This misalignment is
         constant therefore this frame is defined as a fixed offset
         frame relative to the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame.

      -  JUICE_PEP_JEI, JUICE_PEP_JNA and JUICE_PEP_NIM are defined to
         capture misalignments for each of the sensors, the Jovian Electrons
         and Ions analyzer (JEI), the Jovian Neutrals Analyzer (JNA), and the
         Neutral gas and Ion Mass spectrometer (NIM) relative to the Nadir
         Unit base frame. These frames are defined as fixed offset frames
         relative to the JUICE_PEP_NU frame.

   Each of the PEP Nadir Unit frames listed above -- JUICE_PEP_NU,
   JUICE_PEP_JEI and JUICE_PEP_NIM --, except for JUICE_PEP_JNA is
   defined in the same way as follows (from [12]):

      -  +Z axis points along the nominal spacecraft nadir direction;
         and it is co-aligned with the s/c +Z axis;

      -  +X axis is nominally co-aligned with the s/c +X axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the reference hole in the
         mounting plane for JUICE_PEP_NU and at the sensor's geometrical
         center for the JUICE_PEP_JDC and JUICE_PEP_NIM.


   The PEP JNA frame -- JUICE_PEP_JNA -- is defined as follows (from [19]):

      -  +Z axis points along the nominal spacecraft nadir direction;
         and it is co-aligned with the PEP Nadir Unit +Z axis;

      -  +X axis is nominally co-aligned with the PEP Nadir Unit +X axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the sensor's geometrical
         center.


   These diagrams illustrate the PEP Nadir Unit with respect to the spacecraft
   frame:

   Nominally, the NU, JEI and NIM base frames are co-aligned with the s/c
   frame. A single rotation of -90 degrees about the +X axis of the
   JUICE_RPWI_LPBx is required to co-align the PEP JNA frame and the
   PEP Nadir Unit.

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the
   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the
   opposite from what is written in the above text.

PEP JDC and PEP-Hi frames definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Currently, there are two different frames defined for the PEP-Hi group and
   one for the PEP JDC unit of the PEP-Lo group -- which is completed by the
   PEP Nadir Unit (NU) --, each one aiming at incorporating different possible
   misalignments between the spacecraft and the different sensors:

      -  JUICE_PEP_JDC, JUICE_PEP_JOEE and JUICE_PEP_JENI are a fixed-offset
         frames aiming at introducing any possible misalignment between the
         Jovian plasma Dynamics and Composition analyzer Unit sensor, the JENI
         unit sensor and the JoEE unit sensor with respect to the spacecraft
         frame. This misalignment is constant therefore this frame is defined
         as a fixed-offset frame relative to the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame.


      The PEP Jovian plasma Dynamics and Composition analyzer Unit frame
      -- JUICE_PEP_JDC -- is defined as a fixed-offset frame relative to
      the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame as follows (from [12]):

      -  +Z axis points along the JDC sensor boresight and is rotated
         45 degrees from the s/c -Z axis around the s/c Y axis towards the
         s/c X axis;

      -  +X axis is nominally co-aligned with the s/c Y axis and;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at sensor's geometrical
         center.


      The JoEE spectometer Unit frame -- JUICE_PEP_JOEE -- is defined as
      a fixed-offset frame relative to the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame as
      follows (from [12]):

      -  +X axis points along the JoEE sensor boresight and is rotated
         8 degrees from the s/c -Z axis around the s/c X axis towards the
         s/c -Y axis;

      -  +Z axis is nominally co-aligned with the s/c -X axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at sensor's geometrical
         center.


      The PEP JENI Unit frame -- JUICE_PEP_JENI -- is defined as a
      fixed-offset frame relative to the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame as
      follows (from [12]):

      -  +X axis is nominally co-aligned with the s/c X axis and;

      -  +Z axis points along the JENI sensor boresight and is rotated
         10 degrees from the s/c Z axis around the s/c X axis towards the
         s/c Y axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at sensor's geometrical
         center.


   This diagram illustrates the PEP Zenit Unit frames orientation
   with respect to the spacecraft frame.

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the
   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the
   opposite from what is written in the above text.

RIME base frame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   RIME is a radar sounders nadir-looking active instrument based on a dipole
   antenna of 16 meters. This antenna is rigidly mounted on the science deck
   panel, perpendicular to the spacecraft YZ plane, and its radiation pattern
   is a toroid around the antenna's 4cm diameter cylindrical tube.

   In order to incorporate any misalignment between the antenna mounting and
   the spacecraft frame, the frames JUICE_RIME_BASE, JUICE_RIME+X and
   JUICE_RIME-X are defined:

      -  +X axis is along the antenna's cylindrical tube, nominally
         co-aligned with the +X spacecraft axis;

      -  +Z axis points along the +Z spacecraft axis, in the nominal
         nadir direction and corresponds to the maximum gain of the radiation
         pattern for all frequencies within the RIME bandwidth (see [9])

      -  +Y axis completes the right-handed system;

      -  the origin of JUICE_RIME_BASE is the geometric centre of the RIME's
         antenna.

      -  the origin of JUICE_RIME+X is the mounting point of the +X leg of the
         RIME's antenna.

      -  the origin of JUICE_RIME-X is the mounting point of the -X leg of the
         RIME's antenna.


   This diagram illustrates nominal JUICE_RIME_BASE, JUICE_RIME+X and
   JUICE_RIME-X frames with respect to the spacecraft frame.

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the

   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the

RIME Nadir frames and radiation pattern frame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   RIME operations, due to the design of the instrument, are not sensitive
   to along-track off-pointing of the spacecraft, i.e. any off-pointing
   about the +X spacecraft axis will not be noticed by RIME due to the
   antenna's radiation pattern. Therefore, for each of the JUICE targets,
   a RIME Nadir frame is defined taking this characteristic into account.

   In addition to these frames, which are target dependent, a generic
   RIME radiation pattern frame (JUICE_RIME) is provided. This later frame
   is a CK-based frame which takes into account, at different mission
   phases, the target being observed.

   The RIME Nadir frame(s) -- JUICE_RIME_NADC, JUICE_RIME_NADE,
   JUICE_RIME_NADG and JUICE_RIME_NADJ -- are defined as follows:

      -  +X axis is along the antenna's cylindrical tube, nominally
         co-aligned with the +X spacecraft axis;

      -  +Z axis is the component of the spacecraft to target vector which is
         perpendicular to the +X axis, with target either Callisto, Europa,
         Ganymede or Jupiter for JUICE_RIME_NADC, JUICE_RIME_NADE,
         JUICE_RIME_NADG and JUICE_RIME_NADJ respectively;

      -  +Y axis completes the right-handed system;

      -  the origin of this frame is the geometric centre of the RIME's
         antenna.

   All vectors are geometric: no corrections are used.

   The RIME radiation pattern (JUICE_RIME) frame is defined as follows:

      - For those missions phases where the spacecraft-target distance
        is less than maximum RIME operational requirement, the JUICE_RIME
        frame is co-aligned with the corresponding RIME Nadir frame for
        that given target.

      - For all other mission phases, the JUICE_RIME frame is co-aligned
        with the JUICE_RIME_BASE frame, i.e. nominally co-aligned with
        the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame.


   Required Data:
   --------------
   The RIME Nadir frames are defined as a two-vector frame using two
   different types of specifications for the primary and secondary vectors.

   The primary vector is defined as a constant vector in the JUICE_RIME_BASE
   frame, which provides the orientation for the RIME's antenna cylindrical
   tube, fixed with respect to the spacecraft frame.

   The secondary vector is defined as an 'observer-target position'
   vector and gives the Nadir looking direction to the target body,
   therefore, the ephemeris data required to compute the JUICE-target
   vector in J2000 frame have to be loaded before using this frame, with
   target being either Callisto, Europa, Ganymede or Jupiter, depending
   on the frame.

   The RIME radiation pattern frame is a CK-based frame, therefore loading
   of a CK that contains orientation data for the JUICE_RIME frame is
   required.


   This diagram illustrates nominal JUICE_RIME_BASE frame with respect to
   the spacecraft frame, as well as the different JUICE_RIME_NADx frames
   when no roll, pitch and yaw operations are applied to the spacecraft.

RPWI Langmuir probe boom hinge frames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Each of the 4 Langmuir probes of the RPWI is mounted on a separate 3-meter
   long deployable boom. See the latest JUICE structures SPK file [13] for
   the location of the booms on the spacecraft bus.

   The RPWI Langmuir probes boom hinge frames -- JUICE_RPWI_LPB1-H,
   JUICE_RPWI_LPB2-H, JUICE_RPWI_LPB3-H and JUICE_RPWI_LPB4-H -- are defined
   as follows (from [25]):

      -  +Y axis is normal to the hinge mounting plane, pointing outwards
         from the spacecraft bus;

      -  +Z axis is parallel to the boom's hinge rotation axis;

      -  +X axis is parallel to the boom in stowed configuration and
         completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the boom's hinge geometrical
         center.


   This diagram illustrates the nominal JUICE_RPWI_LPBx-H frames with respect
   to the spacecraft frame.

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the
   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the
   opposite from what is written in the above text.

RPWI Langmuir Probe Booms frames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The RPWI Langmuir Probe Booms frames -- JUICE_RPWI_LPB1, JUICE_RPWI_LPB2,
   JUICE_RPWI_LPB3 and JUICE_RPWI_LPB4 -- are defined as follows (from [25]):

      -  +X axis is parallel to the boom, pointing outwards from the hinge
         towards the tip of the boom in deployed configuration;

      -  +Z axis is parallel to the boom's hinge rotation axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the boom's hinge geometrical
         center.


   This diagram illustrates the nominal JUICE_RPWI_LPBx frame with respect to
   the JUICE_RPWI_LPBx-H frame.

RPWI Langmuir Probes, RWI and SCM frames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The RPWI Langmuir Probes frames -- JUICE_RPWI_LP1, JUICE_RPWI_LP2,
   JUICE_RPWI_LP3 and JUICE_RPWI_LP4 -- are defined as follows (from [11]):

      -  +Z axis is parallel to the boom, pointing outwards from the hinge
         towards the tip of the boom in deployed configuration;

      -  +X axis is parallel to the boom's hinge rotation axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the sensor's geometrical
         center.


   The Radio Wave Instrument (RWI) base frame -- JUICE_RPWI_RWI --
   corresponding to RWI URF in [10] is defined as follows (from [10]):

      -  +X axis is rotated around the boom +Y axis about ~20 degrees from
         the boom +X axis and it points from the most inward hole of the
         mounting plate to the most outward;

      -  +Y axis is rotated around the boom -X axis about ~30 degrees from
         the boom +X axis and is parallel to the mounting plate;

      -  +Z axis completes the right hand frame and is perpendicular to the
         mounting plate;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the sensor's geometrical
         center.

   The axis of each RWI dipole antenna U, V, W, can be determined with
   respect to JUICE_RPWI_RWI (RWI URF in [10]) with the following
   analytical expression:

      U = -X / sqrt(3) - Y / sqrt(2) + Z / sqrt(6)
      V =  X / sqrt(3) + Z * sqrt(2/3)
      W = -X / sqrt(3) + Y / sqrt(2) + Z / sqrt(6)

   In addition, the measured alignment of these axis has been laser scanned
   by Astronika [29] and these values used to define the alignment of the
   dipole frames:

      U = [ -0.577913,  -0.706544,   0.408426 ]
      V = [  0.581716,   0.002820,   0.813387 ]
      W = [ -0.572995,   0.706597,   0.415200 ]

   The Radio Wave Instrument (RWI) dipoles frames -- JUICE_RPWI_RWI_U,
   JUICE_RPWI_RWI_V, JUICE_RPWI_RWI_W -- determine each dipole axis
   direction with the +Z axis and are defined as follows:

      -  +Z axis is parallel to the dipole axis pointing outwards from the
         magnetometer boom;

      -  +X axis is defined as the projection of the magnetometer boom +X
         axis into the plane defined by the dipole axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the sensor's geometrical
         center.


   The RPWI Search Coil Magnetometer (SCM) base frame -- JUICE_RPWI_SCM -- is
   defined as follows (from [10]):

      -  +Y axis is rotated around the boom -X axis about ~40 degrees from
         the boom +Y axis;

      -  +Z axis is anti-parallel to the boom +X axis, pointing outwards
         from the tip of the boom towards the hinge of the boom in deployed
         configuration;

      -  +X axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the sensor's geometrical
         center.


   The RPWI Search Coil Magnetometer (SCM) dipoles frames -- JUICE_RPWI_SCM_U,
   JUICE_RPWI_SCM_V, JUICE_RPWI_SCM_W -- are defined as follows:

      -  +Z axis is parallel to the dipole axis pointing outwards from the
         magnetometer boom;

      -  +X axis is defined as the projection of the magnetometer boom +X
         axis into the plane defined by the dipole axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the sensor's geometrical
         center.

   Nominally, single rotation of +90 degrees about the +Y axis of the
   JUICE_RPWI_LPBx is required to co-align the Langmuir Probe frame and the
   corresponding boom's frame.

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the
   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the
   opposite from what is written in the above text.

SWI Frames
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section contains the definition of the Sub-millimeter Wave
   Instrument (SWI) instrument frames.

   SWI is on the nadir platform in order to observe the target in nadir and
   limb viewing geometry. A clear field of view of +/-76 degrees along the
   track for 1) scanning across Jupiter, 2) viewing the Galilean satellites
   and 3) viewing cold space for calibration purpose is needed. Across the
   track SWI needs just a clear field of view of +/-4.3 degrees to scan across
   Jupiter in North- South direction.

SWI instrument Base frame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The SWI base frame, JUICE_SWI_BASE, is fixed with respect to the
   spacecraft and defined as follows:

      -  +Z axis is normal to the instrument mounting plane and points
         towards the Nadir direction; it is nominally aligned to the +Z
         spacecraft axis;

      -  +X axis is nominally aligned to the +X spacecraft axis -- during the
         Jupiter phase the +X axis is aligned with the along-track direction
         whereas during the Ganymede phase, it is aligned with the cross-track
         direction; that is, tilted by 90 deg --.

      -  +Y axis completes the right-handed frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is at the center of the reference
         mounting hole.


   Any misalignment between the nominal and actual SWI mounting alignment
   measured pre-launch should be incorporated into the definition of this
   frame.


   This diagram illustrates nominal JUICE_SWI_BASE frame with respect to
   the spacecraft frame.

   Nominally, the SWI base frame is co-aligned with the s/c frame.

   The instrument alignment has been measured after mechanical tests
   during the fourth alignment campaign as reported in [26]. The following
   misalignment is introduced as three rotations expressed in arcseconds from
   spacecraft to SWI instrument reference frames:

     Rotation = (    0.0,      5.0,     107.0  )
         SC -> SWI     Rz        Ry         Rx

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the
   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the
   opposite from what is written in the above text.

SWI Scanner frame:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   SWI telescope is equipped with a two-axis scan mechanism to allow
   scanning around the nadir viewing direction in a range of +/- 76
   degrees inside the spacecraft's orbital plane (along-track) and
   +/- 4.3 degree perpendicular to the plane (across-track)  during the
   Jupiter phase (see [6]).

   The SWI Scanner frame, JUICE_SWI_SCANNER, is defined as a Switch
   Frame (see [1] for more information) aligned with one of the different
   CK-based base frames -- JUICE_SWI_SCANNER_PLAN or JUICE_SWI_SCANNER_MEAS
   -- depending on coverage and their orientation is given relative to
   JUICE_SWI_BASE as:

      -  +Z axis is aligned to the SWI antenna boresight direction; i.e.
         direction of maximum gain of the receiver radiation pattern. In
         the scanning mechanism "zero" position, it is nominally co-aligned
         to the JUICE_SWI_BASE +Z axis and points Nadir;

      -  +X axis is parallel to the shortest side of the Telescope and
         Receiver Unit. In the scanning mechanism "zero position", it is
         nominally aligned to the +X spacecraft axis and the +X axis of the
         JUICE_SWI_BASE frame;

      -  +Y axis completes the right-handed frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the geometric center of the
         primary reflector dish outer rim circle.

UVS instrument frame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Ultraviolet Spectrograph is rigidly mounted on the spacecraft science
   deck, with its main entrance aperture in the +Z spacecraft panel and a
   solar aperture in the +X spacecraft panel.

   Therefore, the frame associated with it -- the UVS instrument base
   frame, JUICE_UVS --  is specified as a fixed offset frame relative
   with its orientation given relative to the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame.

   The UVS instrument frame is defined by the spectrograph design
   and its mounting on the spacecraft as follows:

      -  +X axis is along the nominal UVS main entrance aperture boresight;
         it is nominally co-aligned with the spacecraft +Z axis;

      -  +Z axis is parallel to the apparent spatial resolution
         direction (i.e. along the slit); it is nominally co-aligned
         with the spacecraft +X axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame; it is nominally
         co-aligned with the s/c -Y axis;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the instrument focal
         point.


   Any misalignment between the nominal and actual UVS mounting alignment
   measured pre-launch should be incorporated into the definition of this
   frame.

   This diagram illustrates nominal JUICE_UVS frame with respect to
   the spacecraft frame.

   The Rotations required to go from the SC frame to the UVS instrument
   frame definition above are:

     Rotation = (    0.0,    -90.0,    -180.0  )
	     SC -> UVS     Rx        Ry         Rz

   The instrument alignment has been measured after mechanical tests
   during the fourth alignment campaign as reported in [26]. The following
   misalignment is introduced as three rotations expressed in arcseconds from
   spacecraft to UVS instrument reference frames:

     Rotation = (    0.0,    -45.0,    -508.0  )
         SC -> UVS     Rz        Ry         Rx

   The instrument alignment has been updated after NECP in-flight correction.
   The following misalignment is introduced as three rotations expressed in
   arcseconds from spacecraft to UVS instrument reference frames:

     Rotation = (    0.0,      0.0,     158.0  )
         SC -> UVS     Rz        Ry         Rx

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation--going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame--as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the

UVS Solar Port frame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The UVS Solar Port (SP) frame, JUICE_UVS_AP, is defined as follows
   (from [5], pp. 53 and 54):

      -  +X axis is along the nominal UVS solar port aperture boresight,
         which is located on the +Y spacecraft panel; it is nominally at
         an angle of 60 degrees from the main entrance Airglow Port (AP)
         towards UVS +Y axis;

      -  +Z axis is aligned with the apparent spatial resolution
         direction (i.e. along the main slit); it is nominally co-aligned
         with the UVS +Z axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame;

      -  the origin of the frame is located at the instrument focal
         point.

   Any misalignment between the UVS nominal boresight direction and the
   solar port boresight direction measured post instrument integration
   should be incorporated into the definition of this frame.

   This diagram illustrates nominal JUICE_UVS_SP frame with respect to
   the JUICE_UVS frame.

RADEM instrument frame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Radiation Monitor is rigidly mounted on the +X spacecraft panel. The
   boresights of ESD, PSD, HISD units and DD central opening are aligned
   with the spacecraft +X axis.

   Therefore, the frame associated with it -- the RADEM instrument base
   frame, JUICE_RADEM --  is specified as a fixed offset frame relative
   with its orientation given relative to the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame.

   The RADEM instrument frame is defined by the radiation monitor design
   and its mounting on the spacecraft as follows:

      -  +Z axis is along the nominal RADEM units main entrance apertures
         boresights; it is nominally co-aligned with the spacecraft +X axis;

      -  +X axis is nominally co-aligned with the spacecraft -Z axis;

      -  +Y axis completes the right hand frame; it is nominally
         co-aligned with the s/c +Y axis.


   Any misalignment between the nominal and actual RADEM mounting alignment
   measured pre-launch should be incorporated into the definition of this
   frame.

HAA ADA Frame:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The HAA accelerometers are accommodated on the +X panel of the s/c bus, more
  specifically in the Accelerometer Detector Assembly unit (ADA) hosting the
  three acceleration sensors. Therefore, the frame associated with it -- the
  HAA ADA frame, JUICE_HAA_ADA -- is specified as a fixed offset frame with
  orientation given relative to the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame.

  The HAA ADA frame -- JUICE_HAA_ADA -- is defined as:

      -  +Z axis is in the interface plane of JUICE with HAA and is nominally
         parallel to the s/c +Z axis;

      -  +Y axis is normal to the JUICE-HAA interface plane and is nominally
         parallel to the s/c +Y axis;

      -  +X axis completes the right-handed frame;

      -  the origin is located in the centre of a reference hole on the
         interface plane between the ADA FEE and the satellite platform (i.e.
         the plane defined by the accelerometer mounting lugs aka datum plane).


  This diagram illustrates the nominal JUICE_HAA_ADA frame with respect to
  the spacecraft frame.

HAA Unit Optical Alignment Frame:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The HAA Unit Optical Alignment Frame -- JUICE_HAA_UOAF --, is introduced to
  identify the HAA attitude with respect to the JUICE_SPACECRAFT frame and is
  defined as follows:

     - +Y axis is nominally rotated 15 degrees around JUICE_SPACECRAFT +Z axis
       from JUICE_SPACECRAFT +Y axis towards JUICE_SPACECRAFT -X axis;

     - +Z axis is normal to the mirror face of the optical alignment cube and
       is nominally rotated 45 degrees around rotated +Y axis from
       JUICE_SPACECRAFT +Z axis towards the rotated +X axis;

     - +X axis completes the right-handed frame;

     - the origin is located in the centre of the cube.


  These diagrams illustrate the nominal JUICE_HAA-* frames with respect to
  the spacecraft frame (where * is X, Y and Z).

   After the incorporation of the Alignment report before launch and as
   stated in [20], the matrix to be implemented for the rotation from the UOAF
   reference frame to the MPO_SPACECRAFT reference frame is as follows:

      M            =  (  0.6734546145, 0.1799083814, -0.7170180921

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse

HAA URF Frame:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The HAA accelerometers are accommodated on the +X panel of the s/c bus, and
   the unit reference frame represented by the position of three spheres (S1,
   S2, S3) mounted upon the HAA FEE box. Therefore, the Unit frame associated
   with it -- the HAA Unit Reference Frame, JUICE_HAA_URF -- is specified as a
   fixed offset frame with orientation given relative to the JUICE_SPACECRAFT
   frame.

   The HAA URF frame -- JUICE_HAA_URF -- is defined as:

      -  +X axis is defined by the line joining the centres of spheres S2 and
         S3 with direction S2 -> S3, nominally parallel to the s/c +Z axis;

      -  +Y axis is the line joining S1 and S2 with direction S1 -> S2,
         nominally parallel to the s/c +X axis;

      -  +Z axis is orthogonal to the plane identified by S1, S2 and S3 and
         such to obtain a right-handed reference frame, nominally parallel to
         the s/c +Y axis;

      -  the origin of this frame is located at Center of Gravity (CoG) of the
         Accelerometer 1 (+Y).

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse
   transformation -- going from the instrument or structure frame to the
   base frame -- as compared to the description given above, the order of
   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed
   compared to the above text, and the signs associated with the
   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the
   opposite from what is written in the above text.

HAA ILS Frame:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The HAA ADA Instrument Line of Sight frame -- JUICE_HAA_ILS --, is the
   representative reference frame to exchange data with other systems
   involved in the Radio Science Experiment (RSE). It is defined to minimize
   the angular separation with respect to the measured HAA sensing axes.

   The HAA ILS frame -- JUICE_HAA_ILS -- is defined as:

      -  +X axis is approximately aligned with the +X HAA sensing axis;

      -  +Y axis is approximately aligned with the +Y HAA sensing axis;

      -  +Z axis is approximately aligned with the +Z HAA sensing axis and
         completes the right-handed frame;

      -  the origin of this frame is located at Center of Gravity (CoG) of the
         Accelerometer 1 (+Y).


   The matrix constituted by ILS axes in the spacecraft reference frame is
   defined as follows from [31]:

                        |  1.33161E-03   -9.99988E-01   -1.33567E-04 |

       ILS -> SC        | -1.00001E+00    1.76662E-03    6.41689E-03 |

   Since the SPICE frames subsystem calls for specifying the reverse

   rotations assigned to the TKFRAME_*_AXES keyword is also reversed

   rotation angles assigned to the TKFRAME_*_ANGLES keyword are the

JUICE NAIF ID Codes -- Definitions
==============================================================================

   This section contains name to NAIF ID mappings for the JUICE mission.
   Once the contents of this file is loaded into the KERNEL POOL, these
   mappings become available within SPICE, making it possible to use
   names instead of ID code in the high level SPICE routine calls.
